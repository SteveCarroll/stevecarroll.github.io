Failure is simply the opportunity to begin again. This time more
intelligently.
Henry Ford
Solving: &rsquo;the&rsquo; &lsquo;henry&rsquo; &lsquo;opportunity to&rsquo; &lsquo;intelligently&rsquo;
HF didn&rsquo;t begin again his failed idea for a rubber plantation in Brazil
at Fordlandia. Brazil gave him 2.5 mil acres and no taxes in exchange
for 9% of the profits.  Starting in 1926 the town was founded by 1928,
but wasn&rsquo;t abandoned until 1934.  Well, I guess you could call the move
to Belterra a form of beginning again and that was a viable community,
but it wasn&rsquo;t until the 40s that production became economically
feasible, and by then synthetic rubber had arrived.  When I was looking
around for more info on the Fordlandia failure, I found a more complete
story at
