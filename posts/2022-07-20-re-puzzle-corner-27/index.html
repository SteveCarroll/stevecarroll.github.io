<p>NA was married to his first wife Janet for 38 y and they separated 4 y
before they divorced.  He married his second wife Carol at age 64 and
until his death 18 y later.  She was against the malpractice suit.  She
was 23 y his junior.</p>
<p>Besides his extensive naval and test pilot flying career, he did a lot
of sail planing, including renewing his currency and gliding into his 70s.</p>
