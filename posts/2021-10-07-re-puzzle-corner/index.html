<p>With the exception of world unrest, nothing breaks out in more places
than an old garden hose.
Weary gardener</p>
<p>There are several/ a number of/ entities that refer to themselves as
&lsquo;weary gardener&rsquo;, so I wasn&rsquo;t able to pin-point which of them might have
been the intended source of the quote, and it didn&rsquo;t seem important.</p>
<p>Solving: I wanted &lsquo;??th the&rsquo;, but I didn&rsquo;t get far until I found
&rsquo;nothing&rsquo; and &rsquo;than an&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I saw an article today that contained the sentence &ldquo;The report said an
estimated 3,000 priests and an <em>unknown</em> (emphasis mine) number of
&lsquo;other people&rsquo; (my quotes) associated with the Catholic Church sexually
abused children,&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>So presumably the &lsquo;flaw&rsquo; in the stats to determine the number of victims
per perpetrator would be based on how ever many unknowns the report is
trying to &lsquo;pin on&rsquo; the church to arrive at their vast number of victims.
I&rsquo;m thinking that somehow this &lsquo;bunch&rsquo; in the commission wants to &lsquo;force&rsquo;
the church to make reparations to as many of the sexually abused in the
.fr nation as they possibly can, whether the church was <em>actually</em>
responsible or not.  Deep pockets and all that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reminded of the boy scout business.  I was active in scouting for a
number of years and when I found myself drifting away from scouting
before having achieved the Eagle Scout rank, I decided to &lsquo;redouble&rsquo; my
efforts to achieve that rank because I knew it would make the man I
called my
grandfather happy as he was a big time adult BSA awardee.</p>
<p>In any case, my point about the BSA is that it didn&rsquo;t seem to me that
the BSA organization per se actually did any &lsquo;vetting&rsquo; of the various
adult leaders I encountered thru&rsquo; the years; they were just men and
women who were interested in scouting and volunteered their efforts.
And no doubt some molesters crept into that role, but it didn&rsquo;t seem to
me that the organization itself would be so seriously damaged because it
had &lsquo;failed&rsquo; to perform some duty that it hadn&rsquo;t even thought of in the
beginning of its existence.</p>
<p>The BSA Boy Scouts of America is the overarching org of the cub scouts,
boy scouts and explorers (that I was in my days).  My father had been a
boy scout and sorta &rsquo;trailed off&rsquo; at the Life Scout level (a level below
Eagle), as I was doing and he never achieved Eagle.  So that was another
motivator for me to &lsquo;get after it&rsquo; and get it done.  That Silver Beaver
dude was his uncle and who raised him and therefore was &lsquo;sortofa&rsquo;
grandfather to me.</p>
<p>And, I was glad I &lsquo;went to the trouble&rsquo; of achieving that Eagle Scout
status before I &lsquo;outgrew&rsquo; the whole thing and got onto other endeavors;
so it was actually more important to /me/ than anyone else.</p>
