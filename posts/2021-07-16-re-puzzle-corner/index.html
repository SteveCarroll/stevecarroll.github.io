<p>Solving: tried &lsquo;I am&rsquo; then &rsquo;that&rsquo; &lsquo;what&rsquo; &lsquo;don&rsquo;t&rsquo; &lsquo;sometimes&rsquo; &lsquo;understand&rsquo;</p>
<p>OW&rsquo;s prosecution under Victorian laws was about &lsquo;just&rsquo; homosexuality,
which of course wouldn&rsquo;t happen in today&rsquo;s climate.  But the homosexual
community of the day included very much of his preying on &lsquo;boys&rsquo; -

<p>The last time I used up the cartridge refilling ink in a kit, I saved
the little &rsquo;tools&rsquo; which include a plastic base w/ rubberized insert for
holding the cartridge during filling and essential to the process along
w/ the little drill and small syringe and needles.  As I prepared to
refill a cartridge w/ a new kit I had purchased some time ago, I
discovered the new kit&rsquo;s plastic base was missing its rubberized insert,
which would have made it impossible to properly draw a small quantity of
ink thru&rsquo; the jets after refill; but it was no problem as I could just
use the old saved one.  Calling saving such parts &lsquo;hoarding&rsquo; sometimes
falls on its face.</p>
