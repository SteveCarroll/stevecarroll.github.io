<p>Spring is nature&rsquo;s way of saying, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s party!&rdquo;
Robin Williams</p>
<p>Solving: B&gt;S, is, spring, party, let&rsquo;s, nature&rsquo;s</p>
<p>RW had diffuse Lewy body disease, a brain condition associated w/
psychological problems, anxiety, depression, as well as Parkinsonism and
dementia.  Altho&rsquo; he had a lot of history of alcholism and cocaine
abuse, at the time of his death, drugs were not involved, as his autopsy
showed only therapeutic amounts of prescription drugs.</p>
<p>A surprise to me was slight pocket knife cuts on his wrist.</p>
<p>I think experts like to call it Lewy body disease as an umbrella term
for the Parkinsonism and the dementias associated.  In some the Lewy
bodies are in the basal ganglia causing the Parkinsonism while in others
the Lb/s are more in the cortical region making dementia.</p>
<p>It is an interesting puzzle about how some people choose to kill
themselves.  I believe the most important thing is to get the job done
and not fail somehow and be worse off for the attempt.  OR &ndash; If you are
just trying to signal to the world and your loved ones that you want
help, I don&rsquo;t think foolish gestures are the way to do that.</p>
<p>The wp article on Lb/s discusses them from a chemistry and biology
perspective; basically there is an abnormal protein aggregation in the
neurons.</p>
