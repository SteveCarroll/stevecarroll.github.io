Without ice cream, there would be darkness and chaos.

I didn&rsquo;t get Dk&rsquo;s last letter G correct, but I did read about &lsquo;his&rsquo;
bridge, a pedestrian-bike bridge over the Spokane R connecting downtown
Spokane w/ a uni and riverside park for Centennial Trail users.  First a
train bridge built in the 1920s, restored in 1988 as a Trail bridge and
renamed for DK, was radically overhauled and reopened in 2022.  I like
parks and bridges and trails for hikers and joggers and bike riders.  I
was never a jogger, but I&rsquo;m a current walker and I used to use a bike
rack for the &lsquo;vette and would drive somewhere &rsquo;nearby&rsquo; that was a better
place to go biking.">

<p>Then he spent many years involved in Running mags and org/s.</p>
<p>The wp 2018 bridge pic in his article is the &lsquo;old&rsquo; bridge before its
most recent &lsquo;radical&rsquo; renovation in 2022.</p>
