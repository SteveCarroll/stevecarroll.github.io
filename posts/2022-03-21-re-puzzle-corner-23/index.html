<p>Sometimes I&rsquo;ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.
Lewis Carroll</p>
<p>Solving: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve&rsquo; &lsquo;sometimes&rsquo; &lsquo;as many as&rsquo;; with those letters I was able
to get the rest.</p>
<p>LC was the pen name of the mathematician Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, and
to be more accurate, it was the Red Queen in Alice in Wonderland who
made the quote as part of a larger one in a conversation w/ Alice.</p>
<p>What I find most interesting about the CLD story is the controversy
raised by his numerous biographers about how his &lsquo;sexuality&rsquo; worked in
regards to conventional female interests vs some form of pedophilic
attraction.  I think the wp&rsquo;s treatment of that area is pretty good, but
one would have to read some biographies w/ various alternate points of
view to get a better sense of it.</p>
<p>In the consideration of naked young girls, I recall a museum I visited
which once
had a roughly life-sized statue of a nude 10-11 y/o archer(ess) out
front; but that has since been put away somewhere.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s one picture by CLD of the naked Beatrice Hatch.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Carroll#/media/File:Hatch,_Beatrice_(Lewis_Carroll,_30.07.1873).jpg">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Carroll#/media/File:Hatch,_Beatrice_(Lewis_Carroll,_30.07.1873).jpg</a></p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t good documentation of the basis for the Liddell family&rsquo;s
breaking off relations w/ CLD who had been inspired by their Alice to
create his stories.</p>
