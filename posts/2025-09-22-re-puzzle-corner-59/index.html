<p>And all at once, summer collapsed into fall.
Oscar Wilde</p>
<p>Solving: all, and, at, collapsed</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not buying the explanation for OW&rsquo;s injury in prison, which ear
condition ultimately led to his death at 46 y.</p>
<p>wp sez &ldquo;he collapsed during chapel from illness and hunger. His right
ear drum was ruptured in the fall,&rdquo; &ndash; you don&rsquo;t rupture your ear drum
from falling down.  In any case, &ldquo;He spent two months in the infirmary.&rdquo;
so whatever happened, it was pretty bad, because the ear or ear &lsquo;region&rsquo;
condition had some kind of surgical intervention (unknown date). He was
in prison from &lsquo;95-&lsquo;97, but didn&rsquo;t develop meningitis until &lsquo;00 Nov of
which he died.  Whatever was going on w/ his ear caused him to be deaf
in that ear and also bleeding and drainage. A doctor Tucker &ldquo;called in
an otologist Dr Claisse, who on 10th October I900, performed an
unspecified ear operation, probably a mastoidectomy for cholesteatoma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since my search (including a medical journal on OW&rsquo;s condition) didn&rsquo;t
satisfy me, I&rsquo;m free to develop my own theory.  I&rsquo;m going w/ the
cholesteatoma idea, because it can be congenital or acquired and is a
destructive growth that could lead to meningitis and death particularly
if compounded by unfortunate surgery.</p>
<p><a href="https://acnr.co.uk/articles/oscar-wilde/">https://acnr.co.uk/articles/oscar-wilde/</a></p>
<p>I say he had the problem before he fell in the chapel; the chapel fall
led to the attention to his ear area condition, hence 2 mos in infirmary
trying unsuccessfully to treat which was chronic and unrelenting and
ultimately led to meningeal and brain infection which killed him.</p>
