An investment in knowledge pays the best interest.
Benjamin Franklin
Solving: the, best, investment, interest, BF
Perhaps of interest to some, BF&rsquo;s wp article refers to him as a
polymath. wp also has an article I found interesting on the term, it
tries to define, and gives examples of writers who have expounded on
defining, and has a list of well-known so-called polymaths.">

<p>Perhaps of interest to some, BF&rsquo;s wp article refers to him as a
polymath. wp also has an article I found interesting on the term, it
tries to define, and gives examples of writers who have expounded on

<p>wp also has an article on the richest Americans, and has a /variety/ of
approaches to that, one of which is &lsquo;by half decade&rsquo; &ndash; that is, the
section divides history into 5 y periods from 1770 to the present (Elon
Musk).  BF was the richest 1785.</p>
