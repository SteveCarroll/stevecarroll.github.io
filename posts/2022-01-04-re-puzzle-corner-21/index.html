<p>The least movement is of importance to all nature. The entire ocean is
affected by a pebble.
Blaise Pascal</p>
<p>Solving: &rsquo;the&rsquo; &lsquo;is&rsquo; &rsquo;to&rsquo; &lsquo;a&rsquo; &lsquo;all&rsquo;&rsquo;entire&rsquo;</p>
<p>There were some things in the wp article I didn&rsquo;t know about BP, such as
his theology and that he died at age 39.  There are quite a few articles
about his medical conditions and autopsy.</p>
<p>Also of some interest I veered into was a discussion of the programming
language Pascal, how it evolved from Algol and later forked and forked.
There was also an interesting article by the guy who dev/d C about why
he didn&rsquo;t like Pascal.</p>
<p>&hellip; but the wp article on that Pascal points out that many of his
objections were remedied by the later varieties of Pascal.</p>
<p>if one really wants to pursue those C vs Pascal considerations further,
there is a wp article on that topic; but in one sense the article isn&rsquo;t
what one might think; as it is comparing the C &amp; Pascal of &lsquo;yesteryear&rsquo;,
since they evolved about the same time.</p>
<p>Blaise is a cool forename.</p>
