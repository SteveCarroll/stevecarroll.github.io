<p>Kindness is like snow. It beautifies everything it covers.
Kahlil Gibran</p>
<p>Solving: &lsquo;-ness is&rsquo; &rsquo;like&rsquo; &lsquo;kindness&rsquo; &lsquo;snow&rsquo;&rsquo;everything&rsquo; &lsquo;Kahlil Gibran&rsquo;</p>
<p>KG 1883-1931</p>
<p>I had a copy; I haven&rsquo;t seen it in a long time.  Sometimes I wonder
where some of my old books have gotten off to.  &lsquo;One of these days I&rsquo;ve
got to get organized.&rsquo;  I attended my book club meeting yesterday; I had
notes on all the things I was going to say about the book if there was
an &lsquo;opening&rsquo; for the comment &ndash; hardly any such openings arose.</p>
<p>There are always a series of questions provided in advance for &lsquo;items&rsquo;
of discussion, but those questions are so &lsquo;generic&rsquo; as to be useless and
boring to me, so I don&rsquo;t even prepare anything for that.  Oh well; my
own preparation was enjoyable to me, even if I didn&rsquo;t expound to anyone
on much of it.</p>
<p>Since I&rsquo;m always doing quotes and looking them up and sometimes finding
the quote has been wrongfully attributed, I was prepared to cite the
Quote Investigator on what I considered one of my favorite quotes cited
in the book.  The book credited Kurt Vonnegut with the quote:</p>
<p>&hellip; because KV put that into a book of his Deadeye Dick, but KV didn&rsquo;t
&lsquo;start it&rsquo; or even get it &lsquo;right&rsquo; - like it started.</p>
<p><a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/09/16/do-be-do/">https://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/09/16/do-be-do/</a></p>
<p>I was also &lsquo;bemused&rsquo; because the author of the book was &lsquo;caught up
in/by&rsquo; the sexual harassment &lsquo;craze&rsquo; that went around a few years ago
(of course genuine sexual harassment is still very much with us), but no
one in the book club seemed to know about that, so I saved it for a
little conversation after the meeting.</p>
