<p>Today i shall behave as if this is the day i will be remembered.
Dr. Seuss</p>
<p>Solving: &lsquo;Dr. Suess&rsquo; &rsquo;this is the day I&rsquo;</p>
<p>DS was Theodore Suess Geisel; his mom&rsquo;s maiden name was Suess.  I think
it&rsquo;s neat/cool when mothers&rsquo; maiden names get to survive.  A close male
relative got his mother&rsquo;s maiden name as a middle name and he and his
wife gave that middle name to their kid&rsquo;s middle.</p>
<p>I once &lsquo;proposed&rsquo; that when couples marry, they have a hyphenated name
composed of her maiden name and his name.  (which first? negotiated)
Their children would have hyphenated names up until an &lsquo;age of passage&rsquo;
similar to the ages of bar/bat mitvah or similar &rsquo;teens&rsquo;, and at that
time, the child chooses which last name they will take into adulthood.
Definitely they &lsquo;can&rsquo;t&rsquo; stay hyphenated.</p>
<p>The other alternative would be that married couple each keep their own
names, the children get hyphenated names which they must &lsquo;shed&rsquo; by that
early-mid teen time in favor of the mother, father, or maybe they get to
choose a last name.  I haven&rsquo;t given that last one much tho&rsquo;t because I
lean toward the hyphenated stage, for the couple and the young children
in the family, but not the older children.</p>
