<p>All the thoughts of a turtle are turtle.
Ralph Waldo Emerson</p>
<p>Solving: all the, thoughts, are, turtle</p>
<p>I observed quite an assortment of misinformation or &lsquo;partial truths&rsquo;
when I searched on that quote by its source. So I ignored the
misinformation and continued to dig for the truth, which turns out to be
the RWE wrote a series of essays (which are provided by Project
Gutenberg) called Natural history of intellect, and other papers by
Ralph Waldo Emerson <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/71558">https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/71558</a></p>
<p>And the larger context of the quote makes more sense than the above
quote in &lsquo;isolation&rsquo;.</p>
<p>There are a number of &lsquo;quaint&rsquo; surprises in RWE&rsquo;s wp article, not the
least of how many people near him died of TB, 2 brothers and his first
wife who he met when she was 16 married when she was 18 and she died
when she was 20.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also puzzled by the fact that he changed his 2nd wife&rsquo;s first name,
called her by several different names, and she called him Mr. Emerson.</p>
