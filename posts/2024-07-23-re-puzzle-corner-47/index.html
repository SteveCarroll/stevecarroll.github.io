I don&rsquo;t know much about being a millionaire, but I&rsquo;ll bet I&rsquo;d be darling
at it.

Solving: I don&rsquo;t know, about, being, much
As I read DP&rsquo;s wp article, I was having trouble remembering what part of
her life I was familiar w/.  I decided it was this latter part:">

<p>I don&rsquo;t know much about being a millionaire, but I&rsquo;ll bet I&rsquo;d be darling
at it.
Dorothy Parker</p>
<p>Solving: I don&rsquo;t know, about, being, much</p>
<p>As I read DP&rsquo;s wp article, I was having trouble remembering what part of
her life I was familiar w/.  I decided it was this latter part:</p>
<p>Since she died in &lsquo;67, I must&rsquo;ve heard her on the radio in the 50s.  Or
maybe I have her mixed up w/ some other Dorothy, like Kilgallen.</p>
<p>I still listen to a reproduction of old time radio at night when I&rsquo;m
sleeping; sometimes it is really old, &rsquo;the war in Europe is over, now it
is in the Pacific&rsquo;.  Germany surrendered in the spring of &lsquo;45; we
dropped the bombs on .jp in Aug and they surrendered.</p>
<p>Solving the Jumble today was different; I&rsquo;ve never done it exactly like
that.  I had two words and wasn&rsquo;t getting the last two quickly enough to
suit me. So I saw that it was easy to solve the final answer, so then I
had all of the letters from all 4 words, and it turned out that there
was only one possible distribution of the 6 letters, these 3 in the 3rd
word and these 3 in the 4th. Then I saw what the 4th word was  and
started looking at the different &lsquo;orders&rsquo; of the letters in the 3rd
word, so then I saw that.</p>
<p>If anyone is looking at the jumble, I only had swept and frisk, couldn&rsquo;t
see the next two, saw that the answer was &lsquo;bear witness&rsquo;, which meant
that the letters in the 3rd word were ATS and those in the 4th were BNE
which gave me beyond first and then pastor.</p>
