All that we see or seek is but a dream within a dream.
Edgar Allan Poe
Here&rsquo;s the poem:
https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/52829/a-dream-within-a-dream
I kinda like that one, as a non-appreciator of poetry, generally.
What I find &lsquo;ironic&rsquo; or Poe-etic is the complete (IMO) mystery
concerning the circumstances of the days before and the days of Poe&rsquo;s
death. That story gets a completely separate article from his bio in the
wp. On top of that, some cardiologist wrote an article in a MD medical
journal in &lsquo;96 deriving the idea that Poe had died of /rabies/. That
idea is more bizarre than some of the other ideas that were floated.
There was no death certificate or &lsquo;investigation&rsquo; and the doctor
attending has been deemed unreliable.">
