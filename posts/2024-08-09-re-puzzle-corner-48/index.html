It isn&rsquo;t the mountains ahead that wear you down. It&rsquo;s the pebble in your
shoe.
Muhammad Ali
Solving: it isn&rsquo;t the, that, ahead, in your shoe
I remember the 1960 summer Olympics when 18 y/o Cassius Clay won the
gold as a light heavyweight and also his defeat of Sonny Liston in &lsquo;64.
The .mil business for CC/MA was all the news back in those days, because
my .us friends his age were dealing w/ the same Viet Nam draft
conscription, as you reg&rsquo;d for the draft at age 18 and were classified
as 1A and were liable to be drafted and probably go to VN unless your
classification changed for &lsquo;something or other&rsquo;.  Mine was changed to
2S, the student deferment for a long time, but during that &rsquo;long time&rsquo;
my draft age eligibility went up to 35 and I ultimately became an
&lsquo;obligated volunteer&rsquo;.">
