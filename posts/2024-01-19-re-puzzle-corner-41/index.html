Cooking is like love. It should be entered into with abandon, or not at
all.
Julia Child
Solving: or not at all, is like love
Some of the parts of JC&rsquo;s story I like are about her sports background
(6&#39;2&quot; tall) and the fact that she grew up in a home w/ a cook and had
nothing to do w/ cooking until she married a man whose
family background was food interest.">

<p>Some of the parts of JC&rsquo;s story I like are about her sports background
(6'2&quot; tall) and the fact that she grew up in a home w/ a cook and had
nothing to do w/ cooking until she married a man whose
family background was food interest.</p>
<p>I also find it interesting that her height influenced which branch of
the .mil service she was able to enter in WW II.  Too tall to be a WAC
or WAVE.</p>
<p>But it was really Paris food and her husband that got her into cooking.</p>
