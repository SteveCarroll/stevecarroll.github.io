An American has not seen the United States until he has seen Mardi Gras
in New Orleans.
Mark Twain
I&rsquo;ve never done MG in NOLA, but I have a nola story about a friend; well
two friends, I knew them separately and dating other people before they
married.  She was a nurse, he studied and practiced a long time to
become a plastic surgeon and started his practice of course doing a lot
of breast implants. He was soon sued when there were some faulty
implants which leaked.  This caused /him/ to sue the implant company and
they settled with him for millions and millions; and he was also
relieved of the suits against him.  He and his wife promptly bought an
island and retired there, but missed the States, so they sold the island
and moved to a nice place near the French Quarter where MG goes on.">

two friends, I knew them separately and dating other people before they

<p>The reason /I/ would never live in NOLA is that I would never live in a
city or part of a city which was below sea level, unless the water were
being managed by Dutch water engineers who do a MUCH better job than
their .usian counteparts.</p>
