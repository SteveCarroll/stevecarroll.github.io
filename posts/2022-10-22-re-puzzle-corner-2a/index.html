People who think they know everything are a great annoyance to those of
us who do.
Isaac Asimov
Solving: &lsquo;people who&rsquo; &rsquo;think they know everything&rsquo;
More than half a dozen words were reorganized by the online OCR.  I&rsquo;m
still baffled by how that algo is written in some vain attempt to
do/perform/say something or other that it should just stay out of and
perform just its proper character recognition business.  When it messes
up so much, it would be quicker to do it manually; alternatively use
some other tool.  You can&rsquo;t really tell how much time you are going to
waste on the rearranging until you are in the middle of it and might as
well finish that way.  It is like having an &lsquo;able assistant&rsquo; who drops
the ball every once in a while which requires doing his job all over
again.  You can&rsquo;t decide whether to fire him or keep doing it the same way.">

<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting quote by IA; he was a very smart multi-talented
&lsquo;genius&rsquo; who knew a lot about a lot of things; and since he was (also) a
uni prof, he probably ran into a lot of people who tho&rsquo;t they were
pretty smart, but who weren&rsquo;t nearly as smart as he was.  I&rsquo;ve been
around some of those environments, seeing very smart people run into
<em>really</em> smart people; and seeing very hard-working and smart people who
run into <em>really</em> hard-working who are also <em>really</em> smart people.  They
are phenomenal.</p>
<p>(But) It is a lot easier to be kinda smart and fairly lazy :-)</p>
