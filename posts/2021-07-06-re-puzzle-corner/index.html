Deciding what to say about AR was a puzzle in itself, since I decided to
approach her from the philosopher angle.  Her ideas have been embraced
by libertarians and conservatives which I would consider myself with
trace elements of liberalism.
I read The Fountainhead in hs, presumably my mother&rsquo;s book, a &lsquo;43 best
seller and a &lsquo;49 movie. When I was reading AR&rsquo;s wp article, I wanted to
&lsquo;dissect&rsquo; the concept of philosophy, but then I decided I needed to sort
the academic disciplines first.">

<p>A creative man is motivated by the desire to achieve, not by the desire
to beat others.
Ayn Rand</p>
<p>Deciding what to say about AR was a puzzle in itself, since I decided to
approach her from the philosopher angle.  Her ideas have been embraced
by libertarians and conservatives which I would consider myself with
trace elements of liberalism.</p>
<p>I read The Fountainhead in hs, presumably my mother&rsquo;s book, a &lsquo;43 best
seller and a &lsquo;49 movie. When I was reading AR&rsquo;s wp article, I wanted to
&lsquo;dissect&rsquo; the concept of philosophy, but then I decided I needed to sort
the academic disciplines first.</p>
<p>The wp article sorted them into humanities, subdivided sciences into
social, natural, formal, and applied.  It divided humanities into arts
performing and visual, history, languages &amp; literature, law, philosophy
&amp; theology.</p>
<p>So, we have the humanities studying human society &amp; culture, while
philosophy&rsquo;s field of study has evolved greatly over the centuries, from
&lsquo;all bodies of knowledge&rsquo; and a wp article characterizes today&rsquo;s
philosophy study as:</p>
<p>(and other subfields)</p>
<p>So AR became a success w/ The Fountainhead which led to her surrounding
herself w/ followers and like-minded and led to Atlas Shrugged, which
was her last novel and so-called magnum opus and she was off into her
philosopher role of Objectivism, which has its own wp article as it
extended from AR in the 50s &amp; 60s and beyond to the present.</p>
<p>There have been numerous books about AR &amp; her philosophy, for and
against, including characterizing many followers as &lsquo;cultish&rsquo;.</p>
