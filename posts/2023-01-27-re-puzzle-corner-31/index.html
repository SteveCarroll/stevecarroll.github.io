Good friends, good books and a sleepy conscience: this is the ideal life.
Mark Twain
Solving: &lsquo;good&rsquo; &rsquo;this is the&rsquo; &lsquo;friends&rsquo; &lsquo;ideal life&rsquo;
While I was looking around to see if anyone explained just what he had
in mind w/ &lsquo;sleepy conscience&rsquo; I ran into a rather dumb explanation
which mentioned that the quote also appeared in the &lsquo;album&rsquo; (?) of
Archduchess Marie Therese (of Austria) which led me to some more reading
about the some 20 months he spent in Vienna which led to some more
reading about whereall he traveled/lived.  It seems like a strange life
to me.  Traveling is one thing; living there is another thing; MT seemed
to do something &rsquo;else&rsquo;; and his wife and children w/ him, for quite a
number of years.">
