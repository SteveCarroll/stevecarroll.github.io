I am out with lanterns, looking for myself.
Emily Dickinson
Solving: I am - Emily Dickinson - lanterns
Some ED tidbits:
ED 1830-1886
(Todd first pub&rsquo;d heavily edited content in 1890)
The ED/Susan relationship story as told by the wp reminds me of a movie
I saw recently starring Audrey Hepburn and Shirley Maclain - The Children&rsquo;s
Hour.  The two were like &lsquo;sisters&rsquo; in their directorship of a private
boarding school for girls, but &lsquo;climaxes&rsquo; w/ devastating wrongful
accusations of the two being lovers. Ultimately it turns out that one of
them actually had wished for such a relationship.  I&rsquo;m thinking that
maybe that was ED for Susan - ie unrequited in a romantic or physical sense.">

maybe that was ED for Susan - ie unrequited in a romantic or physical sense.</p>
<p>(due to the burden of caring for her ailing mother&hellip;)</p>
<p>The wp article spends quite a lot of lines addressing the issue of the
conflict or &lsquo;obstacles&rsquo; to ED being pub&rsquo;d much in her lifetime.</p>
