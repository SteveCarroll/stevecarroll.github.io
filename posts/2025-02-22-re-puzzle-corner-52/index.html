It wasn&rsquo;t love at first sight. It took a full five minutes.
Lucille Ball
Solving: it wasn&rsquo;t, at first, took, minutes
Clearly that was about Desi in 1940.
LB died at 77 in &lsquo;89; interesting case. Many people die &lsquo;abruptly&rsquo; when
something goes wrong w/ an aortic aneurysm. She did it a little
trickier.  She had chest pain, diagnosed w/ dissecting aortic aneurysm
near her heart and underwent 7 hour cardio-thoracic surgery to repair
the aneurysm and her aortic valve replacement.  A few days later
during her recovery, awoke, pain, lost consciousness and died of a
ruptured abdominal aneurysm &lsquo;unrelated&rsquo; to her surgery.">

<p>LB died at 77 in &lsquo;89; interesting case. Many people die &lsquo;abruptly&rsquo; when
something goes wrong w/ an aortic aneurysm. She did it a little
trickier.  She had chest pain, diagnosed w/ dissecting aortic aneurysm
near her heart and underwent 7 hour cardio-thoracic surgery to repair
the aneurysm <em>and</em> her aortic valve replacement.  A few days later
during her recovery, awoke, pain, lost consciousness and died of a
ruptured <em>abdominal</em> aneurysm &lsquo;unrelated&rsquo; to her surgery.</p>
<p>The LB Desi Arnaz marriage and partnership was certainly complex and
lucrative.</p>
