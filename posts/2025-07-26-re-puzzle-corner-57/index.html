If people sat outside and looked at the stars each night, I&rsquo;ll bet
they&rsquo;d live a lot differently.
Bill Watterson
Solving: people, looked, outside, if, sat
The quote is from a Calvin &amp; Hobbes strip. BW is an enigma. After 10 y
of C&amp;H (&lsquo;85-&lsquo;95), he quit the strip, and prior to quitting had been
fighting the characteristics of the industry including the marketing of
characters. Since his retirement 30 y ago, he has remained very
reclusive, w/ very little press.  During the years of C&amp;H, I was reading
comic strips regularly and LUV&rsquo;d C&amp;H.  Now he&rsquo;s 67.">
