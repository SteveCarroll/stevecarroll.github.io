<p>The Fri NYT x-word was hard and clever and enjoyable and I defeated it
(not fast at all).  My &lsquo;system&rsquo; for solving Sudoku also worked well
today; I never had to jot down 4 candidates for a cell.  If there were
more than 3, I made a little mark to indicate its condition.  That
strategy reduces bookkeeping and allows me to find &lsquo;weak spots&rsquo; more
easily because I can &lsquo;see&rsquo; the &lsquo;important&rsquo; whole grid&rsquo;s numbers.  If
there were &lsquo;4 or more&rsquo; numbers in there it would appear more complex
than need be.  Hidden triples are common; hidden quadruples, not so much.</p>
