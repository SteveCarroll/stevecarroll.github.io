Dads are most ordinary men turned by love into heroes, adventurers,
story-tellers and singers of song.

Solving: MUCH much slower to get a toe-hold than it should have been.
None of my experiments were working for a long time.  From time to time
I would go back to SNSM to experiment w/ the repeater S and of course
that included D.  D for Doh!.  I have no explanation for why I didn&rsquo;t
jump on &lsquo;dads&rsquo; sooner.  Once I did that, everything got easier.">

<p>Solving: MUCH much slower to get a toe-hold than it should have been.
None of my experiments were working for a long time.  From time to time
I would go back to SNSM to experiment w/ the repeater S and of course
that included D.  D for <em>Doh!</em>.  I have no explanation for why I didn&rsquo;t

<p>One puzzle that PB has set me off on is a sentence in her wp article:</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m accustomed to having aboriginal nations inside one&rsquo;s nation, but not
usually in a major city, in this case the largest (and most expensive)
city in .au.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t found this unceded Eora land in Sydney yet.</p>
