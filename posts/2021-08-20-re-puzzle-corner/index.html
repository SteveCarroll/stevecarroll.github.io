<p>Artificial intelligence is devoid of intelligence because it is devoid
of artifice.
Jean Baudrillard</p>
<p>Solving:  It seems to me that I had more trouble w/ that than I should
have.  I &lsquo;stumbled onto&rsquo; &lsquo;intelligence&rsquo; fairly early, but somehow I
must&rsquo;ve been making some kind of error because &lsquo;artificial&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t jump
out at me at all.  I had a hard time figuring out &lsquo;of&rsquo; and &lsquo;devoid&rsquo;.  I
had recognized the similarity between &lsquo;artifice&rsquo; and &lsquo;artificial&rsquo; but it
was still a problem.  And contributing to the problem is that I don&rsquo;t
really &lsquo;get&rsquo; Baudrillard.</p>
<p>The wp article on JB (.fr &lsquo;29-&lsquo;07)  is &rsquo;tedious&rsquo;.  There is availability
of reading a much larger context for the CQ because JB wrote a number of
&rsquo;essays&rsquo; incl The Transparency of Evil: Essays in Extreme Phenomena
several of which are available at GoodReads in which the above quote is
available along w/ 350 words of its context, but I didn&rsquo;t find the quote
or its context to be useful to me.  I would have no interest in any of
JB&rsquo;s books or essays.</p>
