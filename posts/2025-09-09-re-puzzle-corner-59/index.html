Be yourself; everyone else is already taken.
Oscar Wilde
Solving: else is, be yourself, everyone
In OW&rsquo;s day, there was a strange &lsquo;culture&rsquo; re homosexuality. On the one
hand, it was &lsquo;generally&rsquo; ignored, while on the other, it was &lsquo;illegal&rsquo;.
But the &lsquo;sad&rsquo; part is that the behaviors when ignored included
pedophilia and when prosecuted was &lsquo;arbitrary and capricious&rsquo;.">

<p>Be yourself; everyone else is already taken.
Oscar Wilde</p>
<p>Solving: else is, be yourself, everyone</p>
<p>In OW&rsquo;s day, there was a strange &lsquo;culture&rsquo; re homosexuality. On the one
hand, it was &lsquo;generally&rsquo; ignored, while on the other, it was &lsquo;illegal&rsquo;.
But the &lsquo;sad&rsquo; part is that the behaviors when ignored included
pedophilia and when prosecuted was &lsquo;arbitrary and capricious&rsquo;.</p>
<p>OW&rsquo;s &lsquo;undoing&rsquo; that led to his downfall from prominence was actually his
own &lsquo;fault&rsquo; &ndash; in a squabble w/ an &lsquo;adversary&rsquo; who called him a
sodomite, he escalated the battle and sued him for libel. The public
battle exposed OW&rsquo;s generally promiscuous and pedophilic crimes (the
pedophilia being young male prostitutes). First he fell into bankruptcy
to pay for his misguided libel suit, then he was prosecuted for his
homosexuality.</p>
