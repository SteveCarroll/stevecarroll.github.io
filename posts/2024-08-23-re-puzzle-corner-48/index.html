If the sun comes up, I have a chance.
Venus Williams
Solving: if the, I have a, chance
Venus is the older of the two sisters, and her talents were recognized
at age 7. Consequently both of the girls were &lsquo;groomed&rsquo; for tennis from
an early age, eg her parents moved across country to facilitate them
training at a better tennis academy than they started.  BUT, the dad
&rsquo;took charge&rsquo; of letting the girls be girls and get their education and
the tennis coach respected his authority and wishes for that.">

<p>Solving: if the, I have a, chance</p>
<p>Venus is the older of the two sisters, and her talents were recognized
at age 7. Consequently both of the girls were &lsquo;groomed&rsquo; for tennis from
an early age, eg her parents moved across country to facilitate them
training at a better tennis academy than they started.  BUT, the dad

the tennis coach respected his authority and wishes for that.</p>
<p>And how about this tidbit:</p>
<p>Hmmm.  I&rsquo;m thinking that is just some kind of public relations, as
Steven Ross the 95% owner has plenty of billions and doesn&rsquo;t need any
other &lsquo;investors&rsquo;.</p>
