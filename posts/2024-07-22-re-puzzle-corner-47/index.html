If you&rsquo;re not barefoot, then you&rsquo;re overdressed.
Unknown
Solving: Quick. unknown, if you&rsquo;re not, barefoot
I was trying to remember how long and how much I went barefoot &lsquo;out&rsquo;
such as to school and &lsquo;generally&rsquo; in my schoolboy days.  Quite a bit.
Probably mostly in the warm weather from the 4th thru&rsquo; the 6th grades,
which warm was most of the year.  Warm summer weather also makes hot
pavement; your feet have to get toughened up against pebbles and such also.">

<p>If you&rsquo;re not barefoot, then you&rsquo;re overdressed.

<p>Solving: Quick. unknown, if you&rsquo;re not, barefoot</p>
<p>I was trying to remember how long and how much I went barefoot &lsquo;out&rsquo;
such as to school and &lsquo;generally&rsquo; in my schoolboy days.  Quite a bit.
Probably mostly in the warm weather from the 4th thru&rsquo; the 6th grades,
which warm was most of the year.  Warm summer weather also makes hot
pavement; your feet have to get toughened up against pebbles and such also.</p>
<p>I made the transition from riding a bike to school to driving a car
pretty early; never &lsquo;did&rsquo; a school bus except for school trips.  In
agricultural TX in those years one could get a driver license at 14 if
they took driver ed, which I did and soon thereafter I bought a car w/
the money I had made working, more in the summers than during the school
terms before and after school.</p>
<p>Barefoot to bicycle to car took place over a relatively short time.  Jr
hi was 2 years 7th &amp; 8th; I guess those two I wasn&rsquo;t barefoot OR driving
a car :-)</p>
