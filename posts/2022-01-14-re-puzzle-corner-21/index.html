Results! Why, man, I have gotten a lot of results. I know several
thousand things that won&rsquo;t work.
Thomas Edison
Geography lessons; I&rsquo;ve realized several things I didn&rsquo;t know; the
proximity of the E coast of S. America w/ the W coast of Africa,
particularly if you include off-shore islands; that Panama isn&rsquo;t all
that flat, there is a mountain there, 12,000&rsquo; from which one can see
both the Atlantic (Caribbean) and the Pacific and there are 3 similar
peaks in Costa Rica.  I knew CR had mountains, having been there, but
not about Panama&rsquo;s.">

<p>Results! Why, man, I have gotten a lot of results. I know several
thousand things that won&rsquo;t work.
Thomas Edison</p>
<p>Geography lessons; I&rsquo;ve realized several things I didn&rsquo;t know; the
proximity of the E coast of S. America w/ the W coast of Africa,
particularly if you include off-shore islands; that Panama isn&rsquo;t all
that flat, there is a mountain there, 12,000&rsquo; from which one can see
both the Atlantic (Caribbean) and the Pacific and there are 3 similar
peaks in Costa Rica.  I knew CR had mountains, having been there, but
not about Panama&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Panama&rsquo;s climate and diseases have killed a lot of people over the
centuries, including Francis Drake.  As far as I know, based on a 10 y/o
article, treasure hunters are still looking for FD&rsquo;s body off-shore
Panama.  He died of tropical dysentery there (the bloody flux) and was
buried at sea in full armor and a lead-lined coffin and the 2011 article
said that the ships associated w/ the burial which were scuttled in
conflict had &lsquo;just&rsquo; been found.</p>
<p>Since there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be anything since then; maybe the
body/coffin wasn&rsquo;t where the ships were.</p>
