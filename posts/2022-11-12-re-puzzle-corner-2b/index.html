It is easier to build strong children than to repair broken men.
Frederick Douglass
Solving: it is, to, than, strong, repair, children
There were certainly a number of interesting things that I didn&rsquo;t know
about FD until I read his wp article.   I only knew of him as a former

<p>It is easier to build strong children than to repair broken men.
Frederick Douglass</p>
<p>Solving: it is, to, than, strong, repair, children</p>
<p>There were certainly a number of interesting things that I didn&rsquo;t know
about FD until I read his wp article.   I only knew of him as a former
slave who became a noted social reformer, orator, author, statesman.  I
didn&rsquo;t know about &hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip; which meant I had to read about VH who I&rsquo;d never heard of, nor her
party.  Nor did I know about the complexities of the 1872 election, in
which the Republican party was split, w/ half of it opposing Grant w/
the publisher Horace Greeley, and then there were other parties besides
the 2 R parties and the Dems, which included the young suffragette VH
above w/ the &lsquo;reluctant&rsquo; FD.</p>
<p>Unlike our recent Maya Angelou who wrote 7 autobiographies about her own
life, FD only wrote 3 different autobiographies of his.</p>
<p>And, I&rsquo;m not so sure about FD&rsquo;s quote above; I think that sometimes it
is very difficult for one or two parents to build strong children.
There are a lot of people who can&rsquo;t guide themselves properly much less
have any business trying to build offspring.</p>
