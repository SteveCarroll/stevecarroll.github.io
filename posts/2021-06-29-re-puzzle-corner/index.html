was talking about there.
One little clue said, &lsquo;Stately Mansions&rsquo; 1964
Huh?  1964?!
So I went to see if the wp could tell me anything about that.  Sure
enough, it was something unfinished that EON did in &lsquo;36-&lsquo;39 as a sequel
that he did NOT want pub&rsquo;d posthumously.  But his widow did anyway, so
it came out in &lsquo;64.">

<p>Obsessed by a fairy tale, we spend our lives searching for a magic door
and a lost kingdom of peace.
Eugene O&rsquo;Neill</p>
<p>As is so often the case, I found myself casting about to see if there
were some useful commentary on some context or other clue to what EON
was talking about there.</p>
<p>One little clue said, &lsquo;Stately Mansions&rsquo; 1964</p>
<p>Huh?  1964?!</p>
<p>So I went to see if the wp could tell me anything about that.  Sure
enough, it was something unfinished that EON did in &lsquo;36-&lsquo;39 as a sequel
that he did NOT want pub&rsquo;d posthumously.  But his widow did anyway, so
it came out in &lsquo;64.</p>
<p>In order to get the whole story, one has to read the article on EON, and
A Touch of the Poet, and More Stately Mansions, of which the article on
him is most interesting.  His dying words, &ldquo;I knew it. I knew it. Born
in a hotel room and died in a hotel room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nobel in Literature &lsquo;36; 4 Pulitzers in Drama</p>
<p>On another note; a site w/ multiple facets, DistroWatch puts out a
weekly column which itself has multiple parts. This week&rsquo;s had an
interesting article which was written in reply to a question to give the
answer to &lsquo;Why there are so many Linux shells&rsquo;.</p>
<p>That section was interesting, but even more so was one of the reader
comments who felt that the web was full of &rsquo;trash concerning Bash&rsquo; so he
provided some Bash resources which he felt were good.  Of those, my
favorite was GreyCat&rsquo;s site where he has a guide for beginners and a faq
that is not so much for beginners as it was created from questions to a
bash IRC.  As he says:</p>
