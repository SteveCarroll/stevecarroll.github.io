Never let success get to your head and never let failure get to your heart.

Solving: pretty quick, I saw the first 5 words.
6&#39;1&quot; VW is 44 now, I think never married.  In 2017 she was involved in
an interesting fatal car wreck for which she was initially faulted, but
subsequently determined not.  Story: she came out of a gated community
to cross a 6 lane highway (!?) with a green light, but in the
intersection she was cut off from crossing by another driver and stopped
in the intersection which resulted in another crossing with green light
auto, an older couple, hitting her car at 40 mph.  Those two were both
injured and the older man developed complications from his injuries in
the hospital and died.">
