<p>Family is not an important thing. It&rsquo;s everything.
Michael J. Fox</p>
<p>Solving: it&rsquo;s, is not, important, family</p>
<p>There are some useful quotes from MJF in his wp article about how he
balances the effects of his disease against the side effects of his med.</p>
<p>Around here we are continuously bombarded w/ TV ads for pharmaceuticals
which few people take, such as Ingrezza (Valbenazine) for the tardive
dyskinesia which is often a side effect of drugs such as those taken by
MJF, which he discusses.  The article did NOT discuss whether MJF
derives any benefit from Ingrezza.</p>
<p>Personally, I think there is &lsquo;something wrong&rsquo; with &lsquo;balance&rsquo; when the
Big Pharm spends SO much money on ads for products that are useful to
such a tiny minority of people.  Somehow they are being rewarded for
that excessive expenditure; presumably by &lsquo;forcing&rsquo; insurance companies
or other 3rd party payors to pay enormous fees for the drugs they are
spending so much money advertising.</p>
<p>Pharmco/s &lsquo;claim&rsquo; they have to charge high prices for all the money they
spend on R&amp;D, which I&rsquo;m sure they do spend, but they ALSO spend huge
funds on ads, which drives up the price of ads for everything else.</p>
<p>MJF&rsquo;s thalamotomy was a long time ago, &lsquo;98.  Tactical deep brain
stimulation is a more modern approach to controlling undesirable nerve
impulses.</p>

<p>MJF is currently 62.</p>
