An ounce of sauce covers a multitude of sins. -
Anthony Bourdain
Solving: &lsquo;a&rsquo; &lsquo;an&rsquo; &lsquo;Anthony&rsquo; &lsquo;ounce of&rsquo;
AB&rsquo;s wp article doesn&rsquo;t provide any insight into his suicide by hanging.
I also don&rsquo;t think his girlfriend w/ whom he was communicating in the
hours before his death has any insight either.  Nor his friend who was
on the trip w/ him.  He was 61 and there weren&rsquo;t any recreational drugs
in his system, or other clues to his motivation.  The .fr examiner
called it &lsquo;apparently impulsive&rsquo;.  Interesting concept.">
