What greater gift than the love of a cat.
Charles Dickens
Solving: a, the, what, greater, than, gift, CD
Once upon a time I had a beautiful calico cat whose heritage was that a
friend rescued it as an adult from a tree and brought it home.  My guess
is that it had never been acculturated as a kitten, so she was never
particularly warm to people, but liked to &lsquo;hang around&rsquo; near them, not
particularly to be petted or purr or cozy up.  Sometimes she did crazy
things.  There were some sad parts about our life together.">
