You cannot shake hands with a clenched fist.
Indira Gandhi
Solving: very very slow, I wanted &lsquo;you&rsquo; and &lsquo;a&rsquo;, but I couldn&rsquo;t get
anything going that would work until I saw IG.
When I was mentally testing possibilities w/ the 2d word, I should&rsquo;ve
been able to see the &lsquo;cannot&rsquo; but &lsquo;could not&rsquo; until I was solid on the N
as well as OK w/ the A and O.">

<p>You cannot shake hands with a clenched fist.
Indira Gandhi</p>
<p>Solving: very very slow, I wanted &lsquo;you&rsquo; and &lsquo;a&rsquo;, but I couldn&rsquo;t get
anything going that would work until I saw IG.</p>
<p>When I was mentally testing possibilities w/ the 2d word, I should&rsquo;ve
been able to see the &lsquo;cannot&rsquo; but &lsquo;could not&rsquo; until I was solid on the N
as well as OK w/ the A and O.</p>
<p>IG was assassinated during her 2nd term as PM by her bodyguards. There
was no kinship between the two famous .in personages Mahatma and Indira,
but Indira WAS the daughter of another famous person, Nehru.</p>
<p>Gandhi was her married name; her hubby was also a politician no kin to
the famous MG.</p>
