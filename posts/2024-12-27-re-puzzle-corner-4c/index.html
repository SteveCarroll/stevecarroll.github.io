<p>The Kentucky Derby winner Mystik Dan was hoping to win the $300,000
Malibu Stakes race at Santa Anita in a 6 horse race; but he didn&rsquo;t even
go off as the favorite, who was Raging Torrent.  RT won; MD came in
last.  A par about the race said: &ldquo;There was nothing great to say about
Mystik Dan&rsquo;s performance except that the colt seemed healthy after the
race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some touts offered that he hadn&rsquo;t raced in 6 mos and he was on
unfamiliar turf, but that&rsquo;s bogus because obviously he has trained.  And
besides that, his actual <em>time</em> was better than most recent winners of
that stakes race.</p>
