The school is not the end but only the beginning of an education.
Calvin Coolidge
Solving: I had more trouble than I should have because I made some kind
of &lsquo;mental misstep&rsquo; when I tried the &rsquo;the&rsquo; and decided it was wrong and
so it took me much longer to accept that decryption than it should have.
As a result, an early word was &lsquo;school&rsquo; instead of &rsquo;the&rsquo;.">

<p>The school is not the end but only the beginning of an education.
Calvin Coolidge</p>
<p>Solving: I had more trouble than I should have because I made some kind
of &lsquo;mental misstep&rsquo; when I tried the &rsquo;the&rsquo; and decided it was wrong and
so it took me much longer to accept that decryption than it should have.
As a result, an early word was &lsquo;school&rsquo; instead of &rsquo;the&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I learned some things from the CC wp article to fill in some gaps in my
American history.  CC, as VP &lsquo;Silent Cal&rsquo; and relatively unknown
nationally became prez when Harding died.  Then he won election in spite
of a Repub split into the Progressive Party.  After that term, he chose
to not run for another full term which he would have probably won.</p>
