<p>Children have never been very good at listening to their elders, but
they have never failed to imitate them.
James Baldwin</p>
<p>I surprised myself at how quickly I solved that one; I saw &rsquo;never&rsquo; was
wrong about &lsquo;seen&rsquo; then &lsquo;very&rsquo; then &lsquo;have never been very good&rsquo; then
&lsquo;children&rsquo; and the rest.  So I was fast on the CQ but slow on the jumble
which usually takes only seconds.</p>
<p>The jumble problem was that the final jumbled answer was in quotes,
meaning it was going to be a &rsquo;twisted&rsquo; word and it was so long, 11
letters.  The result turned out to be &lsquo;masterpeace&rsquo;</p>
<p>The jumble didn&rsquo;t exactly get the date of the Treaty of Paris right, but
that treaty had multiple dates, depending on your perspective.  At least
it got me to reading about some of the repercussions of the treaty, say
in Britain, and the JB article caused me to consider reading some Baldwin.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the JB wp article is completely missing a section for
&lsquo;personal life&rsquo;, but it does mention an important love relationship w/ a
17 y/o young man (wp says &lsquo;boy&rsquo;, at JB&rsquo;s 25) and his influence on Toni
Morrison.</p>
