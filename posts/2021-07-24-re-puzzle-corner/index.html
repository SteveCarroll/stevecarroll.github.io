No disability or dictionary out there is capable of clearly defining who
we are as a person.
Robert M. Hensel
RMH&rsquo;s website is a better source of info about him than the wp article.
He also said, &ldquo;I have a Disability yes thats true, but all that really
means is I may have to take a slightly different path than you&rdquo;.
RMH is wheelchair-bound because of limitations from a birth defect,
spina bifida.   He is a writer and poet, and also set a Ripley-Guinness
record for the longest sustained wheelie of over 6 mi.  Besides his
website, when I turned to the Talk section of the wp article, I learned
that he had initially written the article, inviting wp editing.  He was
also asked to carry the torch for the 2006 Asian Games.">
