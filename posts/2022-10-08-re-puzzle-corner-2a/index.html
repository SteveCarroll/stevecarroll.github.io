Wisdom comes from experience. Experience is often a result of lack of
wisdom.
Terry Pratchett
Solving: a struggle. Finally I saw &lsquo;often&rsquo; and &lsquo;of&rsquo; which opened a
window. &lsquo;result&rsquo; &lsquo;wisdom&rsquo;&lsquo;comes from&rsquo; &rsquo;experience&rsquo;. I wanted U&gt;E which
was right, but I also wanted other ideas which were wrong and slowed me
down.">

<p>Wisdom comes from experience. Experience is often a result of lack of
wisdom.
Terry Pratchett</p>
<p>Solving: a struggle. Finally I saw &lsquo;often&rsquo; and &lsquo;of&rsquo; which opened a
window. &lsquo;result&rsquo; &lsquo;wisdom&rsquo;&lsquo;comes from&rsquo; &rsquo;experience&rsquo;. I wanted U&gt;E which
was right, but I also wanted other ideas which were wrong and slowed me
down.</p>
<p>Never heard of any of that.</p>
<p>2007 age 59 he announced he had early onset Alzheimers; he lived 7 more
years.</p>
<p>PCA is posteror-cortical atrophy, uncommon variant, the back of the
brain shrinks</p>
<p>So, it seems to me that he let his &lsquo;opportunity&rsquo; to be able to determine
when his life would end &lsquo;slip away&rsquo; from him and he lived &lsquo;years and
years&rsquo; in some kind of Alz condition before he finally died naturally.</p>
<p>That is a big problem for those of us who don&rsquo;t want to do that.  Both
of my parents lived long past the time their brains weren&rsquo;t any good any
more.  I do NOT want to do that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure TP should&rsquo;ve died sometime between 2011 and 2015, probably
closer to the first half of those 4 years than the second.</p>
<p>The problem is that dying by your own hand &rsquo;nicely&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t actually that
easy, much less acceptable to such as your friends and family.</p>
