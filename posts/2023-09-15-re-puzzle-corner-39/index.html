<p>Solving: the - and - -ing - on - the stars</p>
<p>There was &lsquo;craziness&rsquo; in CK&rsquo;s story because of the battles between his
ex-wife &amp; children and his current wife, before and after his death.
There&rsquo;s some kind of lesson to be learned there, but I&rsquo;m not sure what
it is.</p>
<p>Players:</p>
<p>CK deteriorated. His wife prevented contact between him and the
children; they sought conservatorship away from his wife; they failed.
Jean took him away from the nursing home; but then Kerri <em>was</em> granted
conservatorship and the court ordered an investigation into CK&rsquo;s
whereabouts.</p>
<p>A battle ensued over his medical care during his incompetency because
his directive said that he didn&rsquo;t want to be kept alive and that results
in medical disagreements about such as hydration.  If you can&rsquo;t eat or
drink and no one gives you IVs, you will die much sooner, and it isn&rsquo;t
as bad a death as one might think.</p>
<p>Then the battle extended over what to do w/ his body.  The court had
handed it over to Jean who wasn&rsquo;t going to do anything the family wanted.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;spiriting&rsquo; away of the body drags the chapters of the battles on
and on.  Crazy story.</p>
<p>The family sued Jean for wrongful death, elder abuse, and emotional
distress to the children. It took 4 y for the suits to be settled.</p>
<p>BTW he was buried in Oslo, to show us how crazy the battles were.</p>
