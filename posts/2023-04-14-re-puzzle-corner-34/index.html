Your wide eyes are the only light I know from extinguished constellations.
Pablo Neruda
Solving: Very interesting.  I really wanted U&gt;E so much that I
wouldn&rsquo;t let it go even tho&rsquo; it wasn&rsquo;t working out because of that K.
 For the longest, I tho&rsquo;t if U were E, then UKUN had to be &rsquo;ever&rsquo;
making the first word start w/ V and some word end w/ V.  Bad news.
 Finally, I tried every letter in the alphabet for the K and realized I
hadn&rsquo;t tho&rsquo;t of Y, so &rsquo;ever&rsquo; could be &rsquo;eyes&rsquo; and the first word could be
&lsquo;your&rsquo; and then I was going somewhere.">

<p>Your wide eyes are the only light I know from extinguished constellations.
Pablo Neruda</p>
<p>Solving: Very interesting.  I <em>really</em> wanted U&gt;E so much that I
wouldn&rsquo;t let it go even tho&rsquo; it wasn&rsquo;t working out because of that K.
 For the longest, I tho&rsquo;t if U were E, then UKUN had to be &rsquo;ever&rsquo;
making the first word start w/ V and some word end w/ V.  Bad news.
 Finally, I tried every letter in the alphabet for the K and realized I
hadn&rsquo;t tho&rsquo;t of Y, so &rsquo;ever&rsquo; could be &rsquo;eyes&rsquo; and the first word could be
&lsquo;your&rsquo; and then I was going somewhere.</p>
<p>Part of the reason I was holding on to the U&gt;E was because even tho&rsquo; XQU
wasn&rsquo;t &rsquo;the&rsquo;, LEU /could/ be, and that would suit the &lsquo;-ight&rsquo; word just
fine, so I was very sure that LEU was &rsquo;the&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really like that kind of poetry that Neruda does; here&rsquo;s the
rest of that one.</p>
<hr>
<p>I love the handful of the earth you are.
Because of its meadows, vast as a planet,
I have no other star. You are my replica
of the multiplying universe.</p>
<p>Your wide eyes are the only light I know
from extinguished constellations;
your skin throbs like the streak
of a meteor through rain.</p>
<p>Your hips were that much of the moon for me;
your deep mouth and its delights, that much sun;
your heart, fiery with its long red rays,</p>
<h2 id="you---compact-and-planetary-my-dove-my-globe">was that much ardent light, like honey in the shade.
So I pass across your burning form, kissing
you - compact and planetary, my dove, my globe.</h2>
<p>But, I did like PN&rsquo;s wp article.</p>
