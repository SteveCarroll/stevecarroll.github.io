Nothing is a bigger waste of time than regretting the past and worrying
about the future.

Solving: &lsquo;is a&rsquo; &rsquo;the&rsquo; &rsquo;than&rsquo; &lsquo;-ing&rsquo; &lsquo;regretting&rsquo;
When I read the JM wp article, I remembered him being in the news in
1961.  There was &lsquo;plenty of&rsquo; segregation back in that day; lotsa people
in segregated societies were in favor of desegregation, but felt that it
was taking place &rsquo;too fast&rsquo;.  Naturally if one were being &lsquo;segregated
against&rsquo; one wouldn&rsquo;t feel that way.  However, there was also a lot of
segregation of black and white which was &lsquo;voluntary&rsquo; black segregation,
perhaps because it was &rsquo;easier&rsquo; to live in a black community than not.">

<p>Solving: &lsquo;is a&rsquo; &rsquo;the&rsquo; &rsquo;than&rsquo; &lsquo;-ing&rsquo; &lsquo;regretting&rsquo;</p>
<p>When I read the JM wp article, I remembered him being in the news in

<p>Those two dates, 1933 dob and 1961 enter Ole Miss, struck me as &lsquo;odd&rsquo;
(older student) but then I read that JM graduated hs 1951, and went into
the USAF for 9 y, which is also a funny number (most people short time
as obligated volunteer in those days or &rsquo;longer&rsquo; career).  There is also
a little bit of confusion in the year factor because one place says he
went to a black college Jackson State College in MS for 2 years, but
that doesn&rsquo;t quite compute.</p>
