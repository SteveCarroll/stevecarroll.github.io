<p>How wonderful it is that nobody need wait a single moment before
starting to improve the world. Anne Frank.</p>
<p>Solving: &rsquo;the that to&rsquo; &lsquo;how&rsquo; &lsquo;wonderful it is&rsquo;</p>
<p>AF (b 1929) &amp; her sister Margot died in 1945 of (epidemic) typhus in
Bergen-Belsen camp along w/ the deaths of 35000 others consisting of
Soviet POWs &amp; Jews.  It was liberated about 2 mo later by Brit soldiers
who found about 60000 inside &amp; another 13000 corpses lying around unburied.</p>
<p>For those who are more familiar w/ the other camps, the wp article on
B-B is interesting, as its purpose evolved from 1935 to its liberation.
No gas chambers at B-B but at its satellites.</p>
<p>Epidemic typhus is transmitted by human lice, as opposed to
some other typhus spread by rat fleas.  The organism is Rickettsia
prowazekii; untreated the mortality rate is about 40%.  During WW II we
dev&rsquo;d vaccine against the org for our soldiers and infection is now easily
treated by a common antibiotic tetracycline which was dev&rsquo;d later in 1953.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t yet found the answer to what antibiotic treatment might&rsquo;ve
been used in WW II, as penicillin isn&rsquo;t effective.</p>
<p>The org is an obligate parasite, meaning that it can&rsquo;t support itself
but depends on its metabolism from living inside another&rsquo;s cells.  After
infection, the louse dies less than a week later because the Rp has
infected its gut lining cells.  Humans in bad living conditions w/ these
lice get the louse feces into skin abrasions, and the organism actually
remains infective a while in dead louse feces.</p>
<p>Reading about how untreated Rp kills is disheartening, but the process
leads to multi-organ system failure.</p>
<p>I found a nice article considering Rp as a wartime problem as the
article has good dev of what all happened before and during WWII, but it
dev/s the story of the &lsquo;crude&rsquo; vaccine dev, not any antibiotic mention.</p>
<p>How about this one:</p>
<p>Wow!  I certainly didn&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>There are also other rickettsial diseases of interest in other
circumstances.</p>
