Barbecue may not be the road to world peace, but it&rsquo;s a start.

For those who seem to be gobsmacked by the suicide of someone who had as
much going for him as AB, I would say that AB was unconventional in many
ways, including his wife/female relationships thru&rsquo;out his life.  My
theory is that he went into some kind of  &lsquo;death spiral&rsquo; over something
unhappy to do w/ his current Asia Argento situation.  The wp article
isn&rsquo;t very helpful on this matter; there are plenty of articles written
on &lsquo;What killed AB?&rsquo;">

<p>Barbecue may not be the road to world peace, but it&rsquo;s a start.
Anthony Bourdain</p>
<p>For those who seem to be gobsmacked by the suicide of someone who had as
much going for him as AB, I would say that AB was unconventional in many
ways, including his wife/female relationships thru&rsquo;out his life.  My
theory is that he went into some kind of  &lsquo;death spiral&rsquo; over something
unhappy to do w/ his current Asia Argento situation.  The wp article
isn&rsquo;t very helpful on this matter; there are plenty of articles written
on &lsquo;What killed AB?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Psychology Today article on that subject compares an example of its
author&rsquo;s interaction w/ a friend AB&rsquo;s age in the throes of a &rsquo;love
addiction&rsquo; trouble/ consumption.  There&rsquo;s a YT vid w/ a dark AB
mentioning &lsquo;killing his staff and hanging himself&rsquo;.  AB was 61; AA 42.</p>
<p>Solving: &lsquo;it&rsquo;s&rsquo; &lsquo;a&rsquo; &lsquo;start&rsquo; &lsquo;but&rsquo; &lsquo;barbecue&rsquo;</p>
