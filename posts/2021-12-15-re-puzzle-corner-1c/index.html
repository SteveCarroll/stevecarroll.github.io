One can be very happy without demanding that others should agree with them.
Goethe
Solving: &rsquo;that&rsquo; &lsquo;with&rsquo; &rsquo;them&rsquo; &lsquo;agree&rsquo;
When I was studying German, I worked on reading Goethe&rsquo;s Faust in an
edition that had .de and .en on opposing pages.  One appeal of doing
something like that is that the .de is &lsquo;better&rsquo; because the .en
translator has an &lsquo;impossible&rsquo; task in trying to be both accurate and
&rsquo;literary&rsquo;.  That is, the reader may think, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say it like
that.&rdquo; pretty often.">

<p>One can be very happy without demanding that others should agree with them.
Goethe</p>
<p>Solving: &rsquo;that&rsquo; &lsquo;with&rsquo; &rsquo;them&rsquo; &lsquo;agree&rsquo;</p>
<p>When I was studying German, I worked on reading Goethe&rsquo;s Faust in an
edition that had .de and .en on opposing pages.  One appeal of doing
something like that is that the .de is &lsquo;better&rsquo; because the .en
translator has an &lsquo;impossible&rsquo; task in trying to be both accurate and
&rsquo;literary&rsquo;.  That is, the reader may think, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say it like
that.&rdquo; pretty often.</p>
<p>The other positive of such reading is that if one has a robust .de/.en
dictionary, one finds themselves reading the dictionary a lot, which is
what the .de/.en v. is supposed to spare you from. A paradox.</p>
