<p>There are a lot of pieces and parts to elements of the CL story. I&rsquo;m not
sure I properly appreciate the controversy around the guilt or innocence
in the trial of the L baby kidnapping and murder. No doubt there was
&lsquo;confusion&rsquo;, but there was <em>plenty</em> of evidence.</p>
<p>CL&rsquo;s initial opposition to WW II caused him trouble, even &rsquo;tho&rsquo; his
later support and involvement remedied that.  His approval and
disapproval &lsquo;ratings&rsquo; by the sequence of US presidents ranged all over
the map; first he held rank of Col in the army air force reserve, then
FDR spoke out against his opposition to the war (1941 spring), then he
resigned that Col commission, then Pearl Harbor and he &rsquo;turned around&rsquo;
and wanted to be recommissioned but wasn&rsquo;t because of his prior, so he
did a lot of things to aid the war effort as a civilian consultant;
however his huge popularity after his historic flight had been reversed.</p>
<p>This brief article at PBS summarizes the story:
<a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/lindbergh/">https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/lindbergh/</a></p>
<p>Later, in &lsquo;54, Ike restored his commission and promoted him to Brigadier
Gen in the reserve.</p>
