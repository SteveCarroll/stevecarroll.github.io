Pain is inevitable.  Suffering is optional.
Haruki Murakami
Solving: I could only get as far as &lsquo;pain is&rsquo; and &lsquo;-ing is&rsquo; and an
author whose names both ended in &lsquo;i&rsquo;.  So I went to a crypto solver
https://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/cryptogram-solver/#!/solve
It gives 1630 possibilities for the first word, 78 bad possibilities for
the 2nd, 2 for the 3rd, 89 for the 4th, same 78 for the 5th, 106 for the
6th, and no help for the name because the gizmo doesn&rsquo;t know about
names, it is a dictionary attack.">

<p>Pain is inevitable.  Suffering is optional.
Haruki Murakami</p>
<p>Solving: I could only get as far as &lsquo;pain is&rsquo; and &lsquo;-ing is&rsquo; and an
author whose names both ended in &lsquo;i&rsquo;.  So I went to a crypto solver
<a href="https://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/cryptogram-solver/#!/solve">https://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/cryptogram-solver/#!/solve</a></p>
<p>It gives 1630 possibilities for the first word, 78 bad possibilities for
the 2nd, 2 for the 3rd, 89 for the 4th, same 78 for the 5th, 106 for the
6th, and no help for the name because the gizmo doesn&rsquo;t know about
names, it is a dictionary attack.</p>
<p>The several word lists don&rsquo;t &lsquo;correspond&rsquo; w/ each other, so the
remaining puzzle is to try to put something together.  Obviously it was
a huge help to get &lsquo;inevitable&rsquo;, but there was only the help of
&lsquo;context&rsquo; to be able to pick &lsquo;suffering&rsquo; and &lsquo;optional&rsquo; from their lists.</p>
<p>Then, w/ the quote, getting the author wasn&rsquo;t hard.  Others attributed
have been Dalai Lama and M. Kathleen Casey.  It sounds Buddhist to me,
but I think HM is a westernized .jp.</p>
