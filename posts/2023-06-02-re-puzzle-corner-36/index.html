My mother shed her protective love down around me and without knowing
why people sensed that I had value.
Maya Angelou
Solving: that - I had - her - protective - people It would&rsquo;ve gone
faster if I had recognized Maya Angelou as soon as I had an A.  I also
could&rsquo;ve seen &lsquo;people&rsquo; on first glance if I had looked closely.  In
goodreads, I saw the whole par from Mom &amp; Me &amp; Mom that the quote was taken.">

<p>My mother shed her protective love down around me and without knowing
why people sensed that I had value.
Maya Angelou</p>
<p>Solving: that - I had - her - protective - people It would&rsquo;ve gone
faster if I had recognized Maya Angelou as soon as I had an A.  I also
could&rsquo;ve seen &lsquo;people&rsquo; on first glance if I had looked closely.  In
goodreads, I saw the whole par from Mom &amp; Me &amp; Mom that the quote was taken.</p>
<p>Personally I don&rsquo;t find it a quotable quote.  I can&rsquo;t see the connxn
between &lsquo;a mother&rsquo;s protective love&rsquo; and &lsquo;people&rsquo; (as in /other/ people)
&lsquo;sensing&rsquo; (as in thinking/feeling) that someone has &lsquo;value&rsquo; whatever
that is in this loose context.  Maybe it was true for Maya or something.</p>
