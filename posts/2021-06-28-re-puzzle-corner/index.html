Can&rsquo;t See series that doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me; maybe the story would if
I heard the entire interview; it is about her being raped when she was
19 and resultant pregnancy and PTSD etc.  that is, I don&rsquo;t accept a
story as true if it doesn&rsquo;t &lsquo;string together&rsquo; - it is &lsquo;suspect&rsquo; - I am a
skeptic.</p>
<p>Curiously to me, she has several fauna/flora named after her:</p>
