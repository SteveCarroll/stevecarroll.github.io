That one is an excellent example of the work the Quote Investigator
does.  I went searching because I didn&rsquo;t know/think JL was a &lsquo;poet&rsquo;.
Those lines are from more lines of a poem written before JL was even
born, and JL didn&rsquo;t start getting attributed for it until after he had died.">

<p>That one is an <em>excellent</em> example of the work the Quote Investigator
does.  I went searching because I didn&rsquo;t know/think JL was a &lsquo;poet&rsquo;.
Those lines are from more lines of a poem written before JL was even
born, and JL didn&rsquo;t start getting attributed for it until after he had died.</p>
<p>If one hasn&rsquo;t ever read anything on the QI pages, this is a good one to
read, for the &lsquo;intrigue&rsquo; or complexity of the chase.</p>
