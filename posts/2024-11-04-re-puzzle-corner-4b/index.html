Failure is the condiment that gives success its flavor.
Truman Capote
Solving: that, is the, success, TC
I like the back story of the relationship between TC and Harper Lee.  TC
was &lsquo;characterized&rsquo; as the &lsquo;funky&rsquo; youth Dill in HL&rsquo;s To Kill a
Mockingbird because TC &amp; HL were childhood friends in Monroevile AL.
Then later, when TC became &lsquo;obsessed&rsquo; to uncharacteristically write In
Cold Blood, HL&rsquo;s ability to relate to the interviewees was MUCH better
than the &lsquo;weird&rsquo; TC, so her work was critical to the success of that book.">
