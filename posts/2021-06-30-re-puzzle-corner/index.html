The right to be let alone is indeed the beginning of all freedom.
William O. Douglas

The GreyCat whose bash site was being discussed also cited a Thomas
Jefferson quote in his arguments for open vs closed:
The business of &lsquo;information wants to be free&rsquo; is obviously at odds w/
some copyright and intellectual property concepts, but sometimes that
&lsquo;stuff&rsquo; suffers an imbalance in which &lsquo;we&rsquo; (by some metric of that word)
suffer/ are deprived/ because the &lsquo;freedom&rsquo; aspect is too limited.  As
an example, big pharma has to spend an enormous amount of money to make
some types of progress, but for which they are rewarded
&lsquo;disproportionately&rsquo; (sometimes/often).  The story becomes even more
complex when it results in discrepancies between what various medical
&rsquo;needs&rsquo; cost the uninsured private payer vs the cost to various 3rd
party payers and the great &rsquo;non-transparency&rsquo; gap.">
