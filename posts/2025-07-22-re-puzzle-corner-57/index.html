<p>PC was busy making hits when she died in a plane crash at 32, along w/
some other country music performers.  They were in a 4 place nice Piper,
single engine, retractable gear, strong engine capable of 180 mph.</p>
<p>The pilot, who was NOT instrument competent, flew off into conditions
which were beyond &lsquo;marginal&rsquo; but definitely instrument, became spatially
disoriented and &lsquo;death spiraled&rsquo; into the trees very soon after takeoff.</p>
<p>That is SO stupid and &lsquo;unnecessary&rsquo;.  There are a lot of ways to analyze
the elements of poor judgment there, including the judgment of the pax
to put their &lsquo;faith&rsquo; in such a pilot of limited skills.</p>
