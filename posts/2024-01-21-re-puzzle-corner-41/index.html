If prehistoric arthropods had used computers, when they stored
information would it be in trilo-bytes?
Solving: if, information (lucky breakthru&rsquo;), would it be in trilo-bytes?
Interesting jumble solve today.  After getting my letters, I couldn&rsquo;t
imagine any words for the solution which had 4, 6, &amp; 5 letter words.  I
went to the jumble solver which of course had &lsquo;myriad&rsquo; hundreds of
possible words.  Nothing jumped out at me as useful/germane, but I
scanned and scanned just reading words.  Then I went back to the graphic
and the letters and the solution &lsquo;jumped out at me&rsquo; from nowhere.  That
makes me think my subconscious brain found use in all of those tons of
possible words.">

<p>This should be about Noah Webster; some other sites like Arkansas had a
different jumble.
