McKinley had handily beaten his opponent Wm Jennings Bryan in the previous election and did it again w/ TR. 6 mo later WMcK was dead by an assassin&rsquo;s bullet that for some reason the docs were unable to find and remove leading to abdominal gangrene and death 6 days after the shooting.\nOne big problem was that the shooting was in Buffalo NY and the hospital he was taken was poorly staffed and equipped; the only experienced surgeon was out of town on another difficult case and couldn&rsquo;t/wouldn&rsquo;t leave it.\nThe wp article on the assassination has a very detailed recap of the inadequacies of the surgical theater and the surgeon, a gyn surgeon w/o the same skills as those of an experienced general surgeon.

Likely it might&rsquo;ve been much more successful had King still been alive to make it flourish.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poor_People%27s_Campaign\nBut it involved &lsquo;occupation&rsquo; in camps of thousands.\nThe other adventure is the James Earl Ray story and the various conspiracy theories.\n&ndash; Mike Easter\n",

One was from various sources remarks about the &lsquo;background&rsquo; of his bi- or homo- sexuality as if that were influenced by his &lsquo;sexual development&rsquo; years including being dressed in female clothing because of the poverty of his mother before he came to live w/ a very prominent preacher who some sources claim to have been &ldquo;fire-breathing Christian and latent or covert transsexual&rdquo; while other sources say latent homosexual.\nGenerally, in terms of homosexuality, most would consider that &lsquo;you are what you are&rsquo; not that you are &lsquo;caused&rsquo; to be homosexual by some parental influence.\nI haven&rsquo;t yet found good evidence that the &lsquo;adoptive&rsquo; parental father role of the prominent minister was some kind of latent or covert transsexual or homosexual.\nThe other item of interest was that CC died of &lsquo;uremic poisoning&rsquo; and hypertension at the young age of 46. The black population has a significant problem w/ hypertension, and if it isn&rsquo;t properly managed it will &lsquo;kill&rsquo; your kidneys and your brain and your heart. Today hypertension is generally well managed, not so much in CC&rsquo;s day.\nThe other trail to go down about CC is the story of the Harlem Renaissance.\n&ndash; Mike Easter\n",

Now, with the new year, we already have 3 minutes more of daytime. One could debate &lsquo;daytime&rsquo; and night because of the complexities of the different kinds of dawns and twilights, which is sometimes fun.\nWhich reminds me of a story. In Mexico, unlike the .us, it is NOT all right to fly VFR at night. That is not altogether a bad rule, as night flying has some disadvantages VFR. In any case, a group of 4 friends and I were traveling in a light plane to land in Cozumel, a small quaint island w/ a small quaint a/p, totally unlit of course and we landed &lsquo;at the end of the day&rsquo;. VFR of course.\nIt happens that there were two federales (armed w/ the conventional &lsquo;assault style&rsquo; weapons) at the a/p. Which was a bit of a surprise to me. In any case, they wanted to &lsquo;discuss&rsquo; whether it was night or not. I know that most people would just figure that the discussion was actually supposed to be all about mordida, but I&rsquo;m not inclined that way, and I was accompanied by a &lsquo;world&rsquo;s greatest&rsquo; pilot who never wants to be in the wrong about anything that has to do w/ regulations or conflicts w/ air traffic control or tower people. Or aviation rules, generally.\nIn any case, we didn&rsquo;t pay any mordida and we didn&rsquo;t get jailed or shot; so I guess we &lsquo;won&rsquo; our discussion and we didn&rsquo;t get into the subtle similarities and differences between astronomical, nautical or civil twilight different definitions.\n&ndash; Mike Easter\n",

Back in the day, the Emancipation Proclamation allegedly ending slavery didn&rsquo;t count for much in .tx, and the story of what got the .us beyond something that was just some alleged presidential edict into something that was more nationally significant was &lsquo;documented&rsquo; in a movie I saw recently named &lsquo;Lincoln&rsquo;.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_(film)\nAs a Texan:\n&ndash; Mike Easter\n",

Steve Jobs\nIn case you are wondering if SJ knew he had pancreatic cancer(usually a very lethal disease), when he said &lsquo;your time is limited&rsquo;, the answer is &lsquo;yes&rsquo;.\nHe said it at a commencement in &lsquo;05, he was dx/ed in &lsquo;03.\nSJ&rsquo;s rare type of pancreatic cancer was badly mismanaged by him. It is impossible to say if he might&rsquo;ve survived it better if he had taken care of the problem conventionally. In any case, he was dead at 56, having delayed conventional management for 9 mo, but living 8 y after dx, including getting a liver transplant besides the delayed conventional surgery.\nThe &rsquo;experts&rsquo; disagree wildly, some say he only mildly decreased his chance of survival by his initial management choices, while others say that cancer would have been expected to be curable managed conventionally instead of the 9 mo of crazy alternative ideas.\nPersonally, I think his initial choices were ridiculous, but I suspect things would&rsquo;ve turned out the same even if he had made the proper choice from the gitgo.\n&ndash; Mike Easter\n",

There is controversy about her degree of disability which was hidden from Kennedy friends.\nIn any case, at 23 Rosemary had a lobotomy mainly because of erratic behavior; apparently this procedure was performed at Joseph&rsquo;s request w/o Rose&rsquo;s prior knowledge; and the result of the lobotomy was a disaster.\nShe was institutionalized and her parents did not visit her for decades. After Joseph died, Kennedy children included Rosemary in their lives.\n&ndash; Mike Easter\n",

The article did NOT discuss whether MJF derives any benefit from Ingrezza.\nPersonally, I think there is &lsquo;something wrong&rsquo; with &lsquo;balance&rsquo; when the Big Pharm spends SO much money on ads for products that are useful to such a tiny minority of people. Somehow they are being rewarded for that excessive expenditure; presumably by &lsquo;forcing&rsquo; insurance companies or other 3rd party payors to pay enormous fees for the drugs they are spending so much money advertising.\nPharmco/s &lsquo;claim&rsquo; they have to charge high prices for all the money they spend on R&amp;D, which I&rsquo;m sure they do spend, but they ALSO spend huge funds on ads, which drives up the price of ads for everything else.\nMJF&rsquo;s thalamotomy was a long time ago, &lsquo;98.

There&rsquo;s some kind of lesson to be learned there, but I&rsquo;m not sure what it is.\nPlayers:\nCK deteriorated. His wife prevented contact between him and the children; they sought conservatorship away from his wife; they failed. Jean took him away from the nursing home; but then Kerri was granted conservatorship and the court ordered an investigation into CK&rsquo;s whereabouts.\nA battle ensued over his medical care during his incompetency because his directive said that he didn&rsquo;t want to be kept alive and that results in medical disagreements about such as hydration. If you can&rsquo;t eat or drink and no one gives you IVs, you will die much sooner, and it isn&rsquo;t as bad a death as one might think.\nThen the battle extended over what to do w/ his body. The court had handed it over to Jean who wasn&rsquo;t going to do anything the family wanted.\nThe &lsquo;spiriting&rsquo; away of the body drags the chapters of the battles on and on. Crazy story.\nThe family sued Jean for wrongful death, elder abuse, and emotional distress to the children. It took 4 y for the suits to be settled.\nBTW he was buried in Oslo, to show us how crazy the battles were.\n&ndash; Mike Easter\n",

Lotsa stuff in there.\nInteresting day yesterday as I explored the opportunities of public transportation. Years ago, I was visiting a friend temporarily living in .nl (Katwijk aan Zee specifically) and we used the .nl local transportation to go to Leiden &amp; Amsterdam very easily and I observed how well the trains and airport were &lsquo;integrated&rsquo;.\nAround here, it is virtually /impossible/ to use public transportation to get to the a/p (from where I live), but I&rsquo;ve been &lsquo;working on it&rsquo; anyway. Usually my trips by air take only a few days. Yesterday I figured out how to drive to a public transport station where there is free parking (for a few days) and use that via 2 different conveyances to get to and from the a/p. Good on me; fun day.\nThe a/p parking lot where I usually park to be shuttled to the a/p is now up to $18/d. That method would be more &rsquo;expeditious&rsquo; in terms of owning your own schedule and saving minutes; 4+ days would cost $90, whereas the other would be $5. Frugality.\n&ndash; Mike Easter\n",

Pablo Neruda\nWe&rsquo;ve seen the Chilean PN here before, rather long and interesting wp article.\nInteresting &lsquo;jury duty&rsquo; today, not from the /actual/ jd, but the processing. I&rsquo;ve been thru&rsquo; that routine many times before, but this one was different. The usual process is that about a hundred or so potential jurors are called together and given info and &lsquo;inspired&rsquo; by a video. Then everyone is told that the usual duty is 1-3 days, but it is possible to be involved in a more lengthy case and if that long time is a problem, there is another process by which one completes another questionnaire in addition to the preliminary one about being disqualified, the secondary one being about hardship of various kinds.\nThen, typically everyone sits around &lsquo;all day&rsquo; - for hours while various jurors names are called to go to one courtroom or another. This is a big city/county w/ LOTS of courtrooms. There is another process there in which the potential jurors are winnowed out, and the excluded ones are done for that jd and won&rsquo;t be called for at least a year.\nIt has been about 2 or maybe 3 years since I&rsquo;ve been called into the big herd and not winnowed until the courtroom process.\nIn that initial process, it is possible for a morning to go by, then an afternoon, then come back another day for more processing and so forth before the selection and winnowing process is over. It is possible to be involved in the &lsquo;process&rsquo; w/o being sent to a courtroom for more winnowing for 2-3 days and then one&rsquo;s &lsquo;duty&rsquo; is over w/o ever having actually done anything except be a part of a great big pool.\nToday was different.\nAfter the usual dog and pony show, the info person said there was a potential for a very lengthy trial lasting 8 or more weeks, and if that were a problem for &lsquo;anyone&rsquo;, they needed to complete a hardship form. You can guess that &lsquo;most of&rsquo; the scores of people in the room stood in line to get the form. That took a while to get past that hurdle, because they needed to get more forms and then wait for the forms to be completed and collected to be processed.\nNext came about 2-3 more hours of waiting, which is usually when people start getting called to the numerous courtrooms for the various trials little or big, civil or legal. But none of that happened. A few scattered individuals were called to the jury services for something or other, but there was none of the typical potential jurors for a particular trial process.\nEventually, shortly before noon (this all started before 8 am) they announced that the 8 week trial wasn&rsquo;t going to happen and apparently there were no other trials that this particular &lsquo;herd&rsquo; of potential jurors was collected, and everyone could go home. Time served. Nobody served anything else but that.\nMy guess is that somewhere in the &lsquo;back rooms&rsquo; there were a gaggle of attorneys hassling over getting their differences settled and the &lsquo;process&rsquo; was able to say, &lsquo;OK, we&rsquo;ve got the jurors here; is this thing really going to trial?&rsquo; and somebody finally blinked.\nPretty big &lsquo;bargaining chip&rsquo; process involving a lot of people&rsquo;s time, both citizens and jury services process.\nMy favorite part of the jd process is the public transportation; this time it was the trolley instead of the bus.\n&ndash; Mike Easter\n",

Anne Frank.\nSolving: &rsquo;the that to&rsquo; &lsquo;how&rsquo; &lsquo;wonderful it is&rsquo;\nAF (b 1929) &amp; her sister Margot died in 1945 of (epidemic) typhus in Bergen-Belsen camp along w/ the deaths of 35000 others consisting of Soviet POWs &amp; Jews. It was liberated about 2 mo later by Brit soldiers who found about 60000 inside &amp; another 13000 corpses lying around unburied.\nFor those who are more familiar w/ the other camps, the wp article on B-B is interesting, as its purpose evolved from 1935 to its liberation. No gas chambers at B-B but at its satellites.\nEpidemic typhus is transmitted by human lice, as opposed to some other typhus spread by rat fleas. The organism is Rickettsia prowazekii; untreated the mortality rate is about 40%. During WW II we dev&rsquo;d vaccine against the org for our soldiers and infection is now easily treated by a common antibiotic tetracycline which was dev&rsquo;d later in 1953.\nI haven&rsquo;t yet found the answer to what antibiotic treatment might&rsquo;ve been used in WW II, as penicillin isn&rsquo;t effective.\nThe org is an obligate parasite, meaning that it can&rsquo;t support itself but depends on its metabolism from living inside another&rsquo;s cells. After infection, the louse dies less than a week later because the Rp has infected its gut lining cells. Humans in bad living conditions w/ these lice get the louse feces into skin abrasions, and the organism actually remains infective a while in dead louse feces.\nReading about how untreated Rp kills is disheartening, but the process leads to multi-organ system failure.\nI found a nice article considering Rp as a wartime problem as the article has good dev of what all happened before and during WWII, but it dev/s the story of the &lsquo;crude&rsquo; vaccine dev, not any antibiotic mention.\nHow about this one:\nWow! I certainly didn&rsquo;t know that.\nThere are also other rickettsial diseases of interest in other circumstances.\nhttps://academic.oup.com/cid/article/34/Supplement_4/S145/295707\n&ndash; Mike Easter\n",

I think it&rsquo;s neat/cool when mothers&rsquo; maiden names get to survive. A close male relative got his mother&rsquo;s maiden name as a middle name and he and his wife gave that middle name to their kid&rsquo;s middle.\nI once &lsquo;proposed&rsquo; that when couples marry, they have a hyphenated name composed of her maiden name and his name. (which first? negotiated) Their children would have hyphenated names up until an &lsquo;age of passage&rsquo; similar to the ages of bar/bat mitvah or similar &rsquo;teens&rsquo;, and at that time, the child chooses which last name they will take into adulthood. Definitely they &lsquo;can&rsquo;t&rsquo; stay hyphenated.\nThe other alternative would be that married couple each keep their own names, the children get hyphenated names which they must &lsquo;shed&rsquo; by that early-mid teen time in favor of the mother, father, or maybe they get to choose a last name. I haven&rsquo;t given that last one much tho&rsquo;t because I lean toward the hyphenated stage, for the couple and the young children in the family, but not the older children.\n&ndash; Mike Easter\n",

I&rsquo;m still baffled by how that algo is written in some vain attempt to do/perform/say something or other that it should just stay out of and perform just its proper character recognition business. When it messes up so much, it would be quicker to do it manually; alternatively use some other tool. You can&rsquo;t really tell how much time you are going to waste on the rearranging until you are in the middle of it and might as well finish that way. It is like having an &lsquo;able assistant&rsquo; who drops the ball every once in a while which requires doing his job all over again. You can&rsquo;t decide whether to fire him or keep doing it the same way.\nThat&rsquo;s an interesting quote by IA; he was a very smart multi-talented &lsquo;genius&rsquo; who knew a lot about a lot of things; and since he was (also) a uni prof, he probably ran into a lot of people who tho&rsquo;t they were pretty smart, but who weren&rsquo;t nearly as smart as he was. I&rsquo;ve been around some of those environments, seeing very smart people run into really smart people; and seeing very hard-working and smart people who run into really hard-working who are also really smart people. They are phenomenal.\n(But) It is a lot easier to be kinda smart and fairly lazy :-)\n&ndash; Mike Easter\n",

My mother was born &lsquo;at home&rsquo; in a ranch house, but she knew when it was and her birth was officially recorded, ie she had a birth certificate. I call it a &lsquo;ranch&rsquo; because there were some animals there, chickens, cows, horses, pigs and no crops; so it wasn&rsquo;t a &lsquo;farm house&rsquo;. Also no nearby neighbors. She called it the &lsquo;home place&rsquo;.\nOh, I forgot; and a GREAT dog. I lived there for a while as a child. Two different dogs, a red chow and a German shepherd.

Both of those people have unusual (well, &lsquo;different&rsquo;) backgrounds and evolutions.\nWhen I&rsquo;m sleeping, the background sound is a radio program which often has interviews of people who&rsquo;ve written books or have some point of view of interest to the interviewer. A question is often about how the interviewee came to be in that field, and the back story route is often very different from the end result.\n&ndash; Mike Easter\n",

Personally I think the best way to be linux curious is to try out a LOT of linux distro/s as live boots, usually w/o applying persistence. I think the best way to do that now is using a Ventoy USB stick but there are other ways.\nIn any case, this particular article was about several different DEs, desktop environments, which I think is a valuable concept to the linux curious because it is so different from the Mac &amp; Win world in which the user is provided the MS or Apple result which is tweakable.\nThe article I&rsquo;m referring to is titled The 12 Best Linux Desktop Environments and as a general rule, The X best Xs articles are usually just clickbait; and I don&rsquo;t think &lsquo;best&rsquo; is the operative word here. It could have been titled, &lsquo;a /very/ few words about several linux DEs&rsquo;.\nThe writer is described as\n&hellip; and some other articles at muo are:\n5 Reasons Why Linux Distros Create Their Own Desktop Environments 10 Ways KDE Is a Better Linux Desktop Than GNOME Why Linux Is Free: How the Open Source World Makes Money 6 Signs That Microsoft Is Really a Fan of Linux 6 Reasons Why You Should Try the Lightweight Xfce Desktop 5 Signs the Ubuntu Desktop Has Gone Stale 8 Lightweight Linux Distros Ideal for Intel Atom Processor PCs 6 Ways elementary OS Is Perfect for Digital Minimalists\nand, since I&rsquo;m a dumbphone user (when I rarely use a cell) Smartphone vs. Dumbphone: 6 Reasons to Consider Switching\nhttps://www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-linux-desktop-environments/\n&ndash; Mike Easter\n",

He died of tropical dysentery there (the bloody flux) and was buried at sea in full armor and a lead-lined coffin and the 2011 article said that the ships associated w/ the burial which were scuttled in conflict had &lsquo;just&rsquo; been found.\nSince there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be anything since then; maybe the body/coffin wasn&rsquo;t where the ships were.\n&ndash; Mike Easter\n",

That is, the reader may think, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say it like that.&rdquo; pretty often.\nThe other positive of such reading is that if one has a robust .de/.en dictionary, one finds themselves reading the dictionary a lot, which is what the .de/.en v. is supposed to spare you from.

There was &lsquo;plenty of&rsquo; segregation back in that day; lotsa people in segregated societies were in favor of desegregation, but felt that it was taking place &rsquo;too fast&rsquo;. Naturally if one were being &lsquo;segregated against&rsquo; one wouldn&rsquo;t feel that way. However, there was also a lot of segregation of black and white which was &lsquo;voluntary&rsquo; black segregation, perhaps because it was &rsquo;easier&rsquo; to live in a black community than not.\nThose two dates, 1933 dob and 1961 enter Ole Miss, struck me as &lsquo;odd&rsquo; (older student) but then I read that JM graduated hs 1951, and went into the USAF for 9 y, which is also a funny number (most people short time as obligated volunteer in those days or &rsquo;longer&rsquo; career). There is also a little bit of confusion in the year factor because one place says he went to a black college Jackson State College in MS for 2 years, but that doesn&rsquo;t quite compute.\n&ndash; Mike Easter\n",

Weary gardener\nThere are several/ a number of/ entities that refer to themselves as &lsquo;weary gardener&rsquo;, so I wasn&rsquo;t able to pin-point which of them might have been the intended source of the quote, and it didn&rsquo;t seem important.\nSolving: I wanted &lsquo;??th the&rsquo;, but I didn&rsquo;t get far until I found &rsquo;nothing&rsquo; and &rsquo;than an&rsquo;.\nI saw an article today that contained the sentence &ldquo;The report said an estimated 3,000 priests and an unknown (emphasis mine) number of &lsquo;other people&rsquo; (my quotes) associated with the Catholic Church sexually abused children,&hellip;&rdquo;\nSo presumably the &lsquo;flaw&rsquo; in the stats to determine the number of victims per perpetrator would be based on how ever many unknowns the report is trying to &lsquo;pin on&rsquo; the church to arrive at their vast number of victims. I&rsquo;m thinking that somehow this &lsquo;bunch&rsquo; in the commission wants to &lsquo;force&rsquo; the church to make reparations to as many of the sexually abused in the .fr nation as they possibly can, whether the church was actually responsible or not. Deep pockets and all that.\nI&rsquo;m reminded of the boy scout business. I was active in scouting for a number of years and when I found myself drifting away from scouting before having achieved the Eagle Scout rank, I decided to &lsquo;redouble&rsquo; my efforts to achieve that rank because I knew it would make the man I called my grandfather happy as he was a big time adult BSA awardee.\nIn any case, my point about the BSA is that it didn&rsquo;t seem to me that the BSA organization per se actually did any &lsquo;vetting&rsquo; of the various adult leaders I encountered thru&rsquo; the years; they were just men and women who were interested in scouting and volunteered their efforts. And no doubt some molesters crept into that role, but it didn&rsquo;t seem to me that the organization itself would be so seriously damaged because it had &lsquo;failed&rsquo; to perform some duty that it hadn&rsquo;t even thought of in the beginning of its existence.\nThe BSA Boy Scouts of America is the overarching org of the cub scouts, boy scouts and explorers (that I was in my days). My father had been a boy scout and sorta &rsquo;trailed off&rsquo; at the Life Scout level (a level below Eagle), as I was doing and he never achieved Eagle. So that was another motivator for me to &lsquo;get after it&rsquo; and get it done. That Silver Beaver dude was his uncle and who raised him and therefore was &lsquo;sortofa&rsquo; grandfather to me.\nAnd, I was glad I &lsquo;went to the trouble&rsquo; of achieving that Eagle Scout status before I &lsquo;outgrew&rsquo; the whole thing and got onto other endeavors; so it was actually more important to /me/ than anyone else.\n&ndash; Mike Easter\n",

Ayn Rand\nDeciding what to say about AR was a puzzle in itself, since I decided to approach her from the philosopher angle. Her ideas have been embraced by libertarians and conservatives which I would consider myself with trace elements of liberalism.\nI read The Fountainhead in hs, presumably my mother&rsquo;s book, a &lsquo;43 best seller and a &lsquo;49 movie. When I was reading AR&rsquo;s wp article, I wanted to &lsquo;dissect&rsquo; the concept of philosophy, but then I decided I needed to sort the academic disciplines first.\nThe wp article sorted them into humanities, subdivided sciences into social, natural, formal, and applied. It divided humanities into arts performing and visual, history, languages &amp; literature, law, philosophy &amp; theology.\nSo, we have the humanities studying human society &amp; culture, while philosophy&rsquo;s field of study has evolved greatly over the centuries, from &lsquo;all bodies of knowledge&rsquo; and a wp article characterizes today&rsquo;s philosophy study as:\n(and other subfields)\nSo AR became a success w/ The Fountainhead which led to her surrounding herself w/ followers and like-minded and led to Atlas Shrugged, which was her last novel and so-called magnum opus and she was off into her philosopher role of Objectivism, which has its own wp article as it extended from AR in the 50s &amp; 60s and beyond to the present.\nThere have been numerous books about AR &amp; her philosophy, for and against, including characterizing many followers as &lsquo;cultish&rsquo;.\n&ndash; Mike Easter\n",
